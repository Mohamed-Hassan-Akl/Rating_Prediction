# Rating_Prediction_Problem:

#### Problem Overview:
The growth of e-commerce has heightened the role of customer feedback significantly. With countless review platforms online, every product is subject to extensive evaluations.

By analyzing potential listings for wish.com, we can predict the appeal of new products before their actual listing. This process aids in grasping the factors that contribute to a product's favorable ratings on wish.com, helping to better understand its consumer base.

#### Notebook Overview:
This document aims to forecast product ratings based on known features within Wish.com’s context, where ratings range from 1 to 5 – with higher ratings indicating greater customer satisfaction. The analysis employs four different algorithms across three unique data sets.

### Outcome:
Applied four different machine learning algorithms across three datasets to assess model performance and understand customer preferences. Identified that Random Forest and Support Vector Classifier models significantly outperformed the Naive Bayes and Decision Tree classifiers. Concluded with the selection of the Random Forest model due to its lowest generalization error, enhancing the accuracy of product rating predictions.
